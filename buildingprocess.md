# Building a ClickBank-like Digital Marketplace with Next.js, Shadcn/UI, Stripe Connect, and Supabase

This article details the step-by-step development of a digital marketplace application similar to ClickBank.  The application leverages Next.js 14 with App Router for the frontend, Shadcn/UI for UI components, Stripe Connect for secure payment processing, and Supabase for backend services including database management, user authentication, and analytics. The goal is to create a platform where users can list and sell digital products and services, with affiliate marketers earning commissions on sales.

## Project Overview and Requirements

The core functionality of the marketplace includes:

* **User Authentication & Management:** Secure user registration, login, and profile management using Supabase Auth.
* **Product/Service Listing:**  A system for vendors to create detailed listings, including pricing, descriptions, and commission structures.  Vendors will have the ability to set custom commission rates and payout schedules (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly).
* **Affiliate Marketing:**  A mechanism for affiliates to register, generate unique affiliate links, and track their sales performance and earnings.
* **Secure Payment Processing:** Integration with Stripe Connect to handle payments securely and automate affiliate payouts.
* **Affiliate Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard for affiliates to monitor sales, commissions, and payout history.


## Development Stages and Implementation Details

The development process followed an iterative approach, focusing on building core features incrementally.

### Stage 1: Initial Setup and Database Schema

The initial phase focused on setting up the foundational infrastructure and database schema. This involved:

* **Project Initialization:** Creating the `package.json` file, installing necessary packages (`npm install`), and setting up the basic Next.js application structure.
* **Database Design:** Designing and implementing a comprehensive Supabase database schema including tables for:
    * **`profiles`:**  Storing user information, including roles (vendor, affiliate, or both).
    * **`products`:**  Storing product/service details, pricing, commission rates, and vendor information.
    * **`affiliates`:** Storing affiliate user information, payout schedules, and payment details.
    * **`sales`:**  Recording sales transactions, linking them to products and affiliates.
    * **`payouts`:** Tracking payouts made to affiliates.
* **Security Implementation:** Implementing Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to enforce data access restrictions based on user roles.  This includes the use of enums and database triggers to maintain data integrity.
* **Frontend Structure:** Setting up the basic layout using Shadcn/UI components, creating a responsive navbar, and designing a modern landing page.


### Stage 2: Adding Missing Components and Core Functionality

This stage addressed missing components and built essential features for product management:

* **Theme Provider:**  A component was added to manage the application's theme.
* **Utility Functions:** Helper functions were created for code reusability.
* **Product Listing Page:** A page displaying available products.
* **Product Creation Form:** A form enabling vendors to create new product listings with input validation.


### Stage 3: Stripe Integration, Product Details, and Dashboard

This stage integrated Stripe Connect and developed crucial views:

* **Stripe Integration:**  Setting up the Stripe Connect integration using the `lib/stripe.ts` file. This includes handling payment processing, payout management, and webhook events.
* **Product Detail Page:** A page displaying detailed product information, a purchase button, and a mechanism for sharing affiliate links.
* **Dashboard:** A dashboard displaying key performance metrics, sales charts, and revenue tracking for both vendors and affiliates.


### Stage 4: Affiliate System and Theme Toggle

This iteration focused on the affiliate system and UI enhancements:

* **Affiliate System:** Implementing the affiliate registration process, including the ability to select payout schedules and provide payment details.  The affiliate dashboard was developed to show earnings, performance charts, and recent payouts.
* **Theme Toggle:** A theme toggle was added to the navbar to allow users to switch between different themes.


### Stage 5: Affiliates Page and Enhanced Stripe Integration

The final stage completed the affiliate system and refined Stripe integration:

* **Affiliates Page:** A page listing affiliates, providing search capabilities, and displaying overall statistics.
* **Stripe Webhook Handlers:** Implementing webhook handlers in `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` to handle payment success tracking, account status updates, and payout status management.  This ensures real-time updates and automation of payouts.  `lib/stripe-helpers.ts` provides helper functions for interacting with the Stripe API.


## Future Development

Further development could include:

* **Commission Tracking UI:**  Adding a comprehensive UI to display commission tracking information in the affiliate dashboard.
* **Affiliate Link Generation and Tracking:** Implementing a system for generating unique affiliate links and tracking clicks and conversions.
* **Payout Request Functionality:** Allowing affiliates to initiate payout requests.
* **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** Implementing comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
* **Improved Security Measures:** Regularly reviewing and updating security measures to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.
* **Scalability Considerations:** Planning for future scalability by implementing efficient database designs and optimizing application performance.

This comprehensive development process outlines the creation of a robust and feature-rich digital marketplace application, successfully integrating various technologies to deliver a user-friendly and secure experience.  The iterative approach allowed for continuous testing and refinement, ensuring a high-quality final product.
